**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using React Native, Supabase, and Netlify**

*Last Updated: September 21, 2025*

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for the mobile app (e.g., in Expo or .env file):

- SUPABASE_URL = https://oluqgthjdyqffrrbnrls.supabase.co
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = [Your anon key from Supabase dashboard]

**Do not commit these to the repo. Use .env files or Expo secrets.**

## Deployed Edge Functions

- callNumber: https://oluqgthjdyqffrrbnrls.supabase.co/functions/v1/callNumber
- validateBingo: https://oluqgthjdyqffrrbnrls.supabase.co/functions/v1/validateBingo

## Testing

After applying the schema, run the test for the `verify_bingo` function:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
node test_verify_bingo.js
```

This will test the bingo verification logic.

## Applying the Schema

To apply the Supabase schema:

1. Ensure Supabase CLI is installed and logged in.
2. Link your project: `supabase link --project-ref oluqgthjdyqffrrbnrls`
3. Apply migrations: `supabase db push`

If you encounter hostname issues, verify the DB URL in your Supabase dashboard.

Deployment
- Netlify deploys are supported. See `docs/deploy-instructions.md` for step-by-step instructions to create a GitHub repo, connect Netlify, and configure CI.
